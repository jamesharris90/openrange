## Notes:

**Finviz Elite:** The screeners use direct Finviz URLs. If you don't have Finviz Elite, the screeners will still work but may show limited results or require login. Consider the Finviz Elite subscription ($39.50/month) for full access to all features.

**Saxo Integration:** Connecting to Saxo Trader API is possible but requires:
- Saxo OpenAPI application approval
- OAuth2 implementation
- Backend server for secure token handling
- Real-time data subscription fees

Let me know if you want to pursue Saxo integration!
